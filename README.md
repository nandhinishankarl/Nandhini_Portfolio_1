# [Geospatial Visualization of Bay Area Rapid Transit Train Routes](https://github.com/nandhinishankarl/Nandhini_Portfolio_1/blob/main/BART_scraping.ipynb)

- Scraped location-based data in JSON format for 6 train routes in the Bay Area Rapid Transit System using Python and BART's public API to visualize train connectivity in the region
- Transformed JSON data into Excel and plotted train stations on a map in Tableau using latitude and longitude coordinates from the dataset
- Enhanced user experience by colour coding the route lines for clear distinction

# [Computational Analysis of Gender Perception in the UK, Capstone Project](https://github.com/niranjanadeshpande/hansardscraping)

- Scraped parliamentary text transcripts from the Hansard website to analyze gender perception in the UK from 1800 – 2004 using BeautifulSoup
- Used Git as the platform to manage version control and streamline collaboration with teammates, ensuring organized code development and integration
- Visualized the percentage of male and female pronoun usage by decade to quantify gender perception using matplotlib observing that male pronoun usage consistently exceeded female pronoun usage by a margin of 75% throughout the decades while observing a 5% rise in female pronoun usage from 1950 to 2004
- Developed wordclouds to generate insights that depicted the trends in terms associated with women from the 1800s – 2000s using fastText
